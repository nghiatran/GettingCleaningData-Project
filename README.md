GETTING AND CLEANING DATA COURSE PROJECT
========================================
## Introduction

The "UCI HAR Dataset" folder contains raw data set. It has been partitioned into 2 sets: training and test sets


## run_analysis.R
* Gets the list of variable names that contain 'mean()' and 'std()' since only mean and standard deviation measurements are required
* Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set
* Clips the data set with activity labels
* Label the dataset with descriptive variable names
* Add subject column to the data set. Data of this column is obtained from the 'subject_train.txt' and 'subject_test.txt' files
* Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject using the 'aggregate' function. 

## Codebook
CodeBook.md is the codebook of the tidy data set created by run_analysis.

CodeBook.md is generated by running the script codebook.R. You need to run the run_analysis.R first if you haven't

    source('codebook.R')
